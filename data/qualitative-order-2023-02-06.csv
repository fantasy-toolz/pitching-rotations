ATL,Max Fried,Charlie Morton,Kyle Wright,Spencer Strider,Ian Anderson,Mike Soroka,,,,
BAL,Kyle Gibson,Cole Irvin,Kyle Bradish,Tyler Wells,Dean Kremer,Grayson Rodriguez,,,Moving Spenser Watkins and Bruce Zimmermann out for fangraphs #5,

CHC,Marcus Stroman,Justin Steele,Jameson Taillon,Kyle Hendricks,Keegan Thompson,Drew Smyly,,,"Tough one! 6 number 3 starters, is this MIN? Moving Adrian Sampson out and assuming Taillon gets more nods with the recent contract signing.",
CHW,Dylan Cease,Lance Lynn,Lucas Giolito,Michael Kopech,Davis Martin,Mike Clevinger,,,Let's give Lance one last sendoff.,

CLE,Cal Quantrill,Shane Bieber,Triston McKenzie,Zach Plesac,Aaron Civale,,,,,
COL,Kyle Freeland,German Marquez,Austin Gomber,Jose Urena,Antonio Senzatela,Connor Seabold,,,"Let's push Ryan Feltner down, Antonio is out until May with a knee injury",
DET,Eduardo Rodriguez,Matt Manning,Matthew Boyd,Spencer Turnbull,Michael Lorenzen,Tarik Skubal,,,"Funky one! Tarik is hurt (flexor tendon) and not expected until midseason, Matt Boyd is back and Spencer Turnbull is back from injury, supposedly they want to make Matt Manning a thing so I assume a long leash.",
HOU,Framber Valdez,Jose Urquidy,Cristian Javier,Luis Garcia,Lance McCullers Jr.,,,,Let's make Cristian a thing and rightly assume Lance gets hurt a lot.,
KCR,Brady Singer,Ryan Yarbrough,Zack Greinke,Jordan Lyles,Daniel Lynch,Brad Keller,,,"Let's make Singer a thing, I like his trajectory; Greinke #3?",

NYY,Gerrit Cole,Carlos Rodon,Nestor Cortes,Luis Severino,Domingo German,Frankie Montas,,,Montas is likely to delay spring training; let's give Rodon his due; we think Cortes can stay in the rotation?,

PHI,Aaron Nola,Zack Wheeler,Ranger Suarez,Bailey Falter,Taijuan Walker,,,,Wheeler will get back to innings eating form,
PIT,Mitch Keller,Roansy Contreras,JT Brubaker,Vince Velasquez,Rich Hill,,,,I'll assume Hill has the least starts as PIT will have long leash for these guys,

SEA,Luis Castillo,Logan Gilbert,Robbie Ray,Marco Gonzales,George Kirby,Chris Flexen,,,"Castillo IP were down last year for clear injury, looked good to end last year, I wasnt to see his value as a number 1",
